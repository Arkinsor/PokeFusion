# PokeFusion

PokeFusion is a web-based application that allows users to generate unique Pokémon hybrids by combining different Pokémon traits, including their appearance and abilities. This project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to generate both text descriptions and images of the generated hybrids.

## Features

- **Pokémon Hybrid Generation**: Users can input a prompt to generate a detailed text description of a Pokémon hybrid using the Cohere API.
- **Image Generation**: A Hugging Face-powered model generates visual representations of the hybrid Pokémon.
- **Base64 Image Output**: The generated Pokémon hybrid image is returned in base64 format, making it easy to display in the web application.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Material-UI**: A popular React component library for building modern, responsive user interfaces.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js used to handle HTTP requests and route traffic.
  - **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
  - **Cohere API**: Used for text generation to create detailed descriptions of the Pokémon hybrids.
  - **Hugging Face API**: Used for generating images of Pokémon hybrids using deep learning models.

- **Others**:
  - **Git**: Version control system to track code changes.
  - **GitHub**: Platform to host the project and manage collaboration.
